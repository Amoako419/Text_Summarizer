# BART Text Summarizer

## Overview
The BART Text Summarizer is a tool that uses the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model to generate concise summaries of long texts. This project leverages the power of transformer models to understand and condense text while retaining the original meaning.

## Features
- Summarizes long texts into shorter, coherent summaries.
- Utilizes the BART model for high-quality text summarization.
- Easy to use with a simple interface.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To summarize a text, use the following command:
```bash
python summarize.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>
```
- `<input_file>`: Path to the input text file.
- `<output_file>`: Path to save the summarized text.

## Example
```bash
python summarize.py --input article.txt --output summary.txt
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Transformers library
- PyTorch
